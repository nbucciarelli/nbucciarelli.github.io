Sorry it's been a while, folks. I am not good at keeping up with a blog. 

2014 has been a whirlwind of a year. If I had told you what was being planned by the beginning of the year, you guys would have told me I was f*cking crazy with no way of completing that list. I told myself the same thing at the beginning of the year.

I wanted to make 2014 special.

- Blog more
- Get more involved in the community
- Certain salary goals
- Lose 40+ pounds and get fit
- Get engaged
- Lead by example

There were a lot of flaws in my life that needed to be fixed.

### Blog more

First, let's start with the negative. I fail at blogging often. Made a goal to blog at least once a week and failed miserably at doing so. Apologies! Let's hope I can keep up this year.

### Get more involved in the community

While I was learning, there was an inherant issue with my involvement in the community. There needed to be more of it. I'm not talking about going to every meetup under the sun, I wasn't participating at all. Going to anything at all would be an improvement. To a certain extent, this was fulfilled. Once a month, I would go to a meetup of interest with no agenda in mind. Just there to hang out!

### Certain salary goals

A resolution/todo list wouldn't be complete without having some vain goals. Mine was to meet certain salary goals. Not only did I start a new job, I also pushed very hard on the consulting front to meet these expectations. It was extremely difficult and time consuming, but alas, they were met.

### Get fit

Truth.

Another goal that is on EVERYONE's resolution list is to lose weight. My health was on the decline. Since moving to Charleston, I have been eating out entirely way too much and eating the wrong kinds of foods. It's been a goal of mine for the past few years and it's never been taken seriously. Until I stepped on the scale in early January, I didn't think anything of it. When I DID step on the scale, however, it was not a pretty sight. Something had to change. If you've been following my blog, you know what's going on here.

Sick gains, yo.

### Get engaged

This was my number one priority. I've been dating a beautiful woman who deserves better then me. Getting engaged has been a long time coming. Frankly, it's taken too long. She stuck around.

She said yes! Wooo!

### Lead by example

Part of my reasoning for taking the new job at The Iron Yard was to lead by example. It was nice absorbing all I could learn; but I had to give a bit back. Whether it was via teaching people programming or teaching people how to work out. I wanted to be a motivation for people to better themselves!

All in all, 2014 was a crazy ass year. If 2015 is anything like it, I'm in for a wild ride.
