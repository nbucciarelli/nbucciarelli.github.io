Monday I got a craving for something sweet - PANCAKES - and I took it upon myself to figure out how to eat pancakes on this diet. I can't eat dairy, soy, sugars, or saturated fats on this diet so that eliminates all of the ingredients to make pancakes. Arghhhh.

Ingredients:

- Protein powder (I KNOW, WEIRD!)
- Egg whites
- Oats

The protein is a perfect substitute for the flour because it's the same consistency and when you mix it into the egg whites, it makes a 'batter'. Granted, the pancakes aren't as good as normal ones, but they're a great substitute if you can't eat the former.

- 1 scoop of protein powder
- 1/2-2/3 cup of egg whites
- 1/2-2/3 cup of raw oats

Mix them together and mix until consistent with pancake batter. If the batter you create is too thick, add some more eggs whites. If the batter is too watery, add some more protein.

Put a spoonful or two into a heated pan (with 0 calorie/fat/sugar no-stick spray), cook until it starts turning brown on the edges - AND YOU HAVE SOME PANCAKES. Mmmmm.

Next, the syrup. What is pancakes without some syrup?

(Walden Farms Syrup)[http://www.waldenfarms.com/products/syrup_pancake.html] tastes ALMOST like syrup. It's close enough and is still really tasty.
