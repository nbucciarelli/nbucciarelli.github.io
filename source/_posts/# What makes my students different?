# What makes my students different?

I love my students. These people are made from the same mold - the most motivated individuals I've ever met. Students arrive in the building before me and leave WELL after me - even though they're done their work, they stay to research and learn more!

Not only that, but they're taking an ENORMOUS workload and dominating these assignments.

I love it! I wish everone had the amount of motivation as our students. I feel like they wake up and say "What can I do to kick today's ass?".
