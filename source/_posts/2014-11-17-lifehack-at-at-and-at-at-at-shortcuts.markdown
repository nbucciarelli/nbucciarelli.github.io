This is a major lifehack I've used the past few years that you all may want to consider, on your phones, make the following shortcuts:

  - @@
  - @@@
 
and make them display the following:

  - email
  - address

Frequently I have family members asking for my address, while others are texting me asking for my email.

Just a handy lifehack that I've used hundreds of times!
