[Day 1 - Legs](http://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/kris-gethin-12-week-daily-trainer-week-1-day-1.html)

Here we go. 

Starting weight: 185.0lbs. 

I have done the breakfast meals (egg whites and oats) and did the cardio already (20 minutes of running). I am sweating profusely because I decided to take my dog for a run. Apparently she is way out of shape. So we're adding one more creature to the lifestyle mix: my dog. We ran 3.5 kilometers. She's slowin' me down!

I was supposed to take before pictures, but I forgot. I will take those as soon as I cool down.
