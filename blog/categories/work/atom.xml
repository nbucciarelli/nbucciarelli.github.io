<p>Here&rsquo;s a picture of me dying. I have the coolest t-shirts.</p>

<p><img src="/images/2014-09-22-progress-update-week-2-and-3/im_dying.jpg" title="&ldquo;I&rsquo;m dying&rdquo; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m dying&rdquo;" ></p>

<p>Week 1 &ndash; Day 1: <strong>185.0</strong></p>

<p>Week 2 &ndash; Day 8: <strong>179.8</strong></p>

<p>Week 3 &ndash; Day 15: <strong>178.2</strong></p>

<p>Current total loss: <strong>6.8</strong></p>

<p>Last week, I did not lose much weight at all &ndash;<strong>1.6 pounds.</strong> Even though progress should not be as large as week 1, there still should have been more then that. There are several reason for this:</p>

<h4>No week should have the same progress as week 1</h4>

<h4>My diet needs to change</h4>

<p>I need to cut some of the carbs out of my diet. I&rsquo;m consuming a lot more then I should. Instead of having 1 cup of pasta/rice, it&rsquo;s being cut down to 2/3.</p>

<h4>I had a cheat day (A day to eat myself silly!)</h4>

<p>Ain&rsquo;t she purty!?

<p>Jenny&rsquo;s, Brian&rsquo;s, and Shannon&rsquo;s (Brian&rsquo;s lady) birthdays are all in September, so we had a big birthday bash on Saturday. I ate myself silly. Hot dogs, burgers, doughnuts, cake &ndash; so much sugar I made myself sick. This was for a reason. Even though this cheat day was planned, I wanted to stop all of these cravings I was having, so I ate the foods my body was craving until I got sick. And that&rsquo;s OK. Now, I ain&rsquo;t cravin' shit!</p>

<p>Cravings were not a huge problem the second week. I am on autopilot now.</p>

<h3>Week 3 Weigh In</h3>

<p>Week 1 &ndash; Day 1: <strong>185.0</strong></p>

<p>Week 2 &ndash; Day 8: <strong>179.8</strong></p>

<p>Week 3 &ndash; Day 15: <strong>178.2</strong></p>

<p>Week 4 &ndash; Day 22: <strong>173.8</strong></p>

<p>Current total loss: <strong>11.2</strong></p>

<p>HUGE week!! <strong>4.4 pounds</strong> lost! Last week was ROUGH. My body is having trouble adjusting to the changes in diet and it&rsquo;s not taking it well. Kris Gethin warned this would happen, but it&rsquo;s hard to prepare for it. I&rsquo;m extremely irritable and can&rsquo;t focus as well as normal. The lack of fat sucks.</p>

<p>The irritability issues lasted a few days. No big deal. I&rsquo;m still having issues focusing like I used to, but it&rsquo;s getting better!</p>

<p>I also ran the &ldquo;Run or Dye&rdquo; 5k on September 20th! It was a ton of fun &ndash; everyone has bags of dye and runs a few miles while throwing the dye on other people. I was all kinds of green/yellow/purple/pink while going to the gym later for my 2nd cardio session.</p>

<p>I am not a good writer, nor am I good in front of a camera. So why not practice both by blogging more, and vlogging more? Day 12 of my body transformation is a decent place to start, eh?</p>
